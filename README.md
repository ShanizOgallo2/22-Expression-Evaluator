Expression Evaluator
It creates a mathematical expression evaluation system that handles complex expressions with variables,functions and operator precedence .This system uses stacks for parsing and evaluating expressions.
Some of the challenges encountered was complex operator precedence but was solved by creating comprehensive precedence table.
the learning outcomes from this project are;
a)Infix to postfix conversion.
b)Stack based evaluation techniques.
c)Function and variable implementation.
